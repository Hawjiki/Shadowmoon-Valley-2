This map is a retroport of WoD's Shadowmoon Valley. In time I will fix all the current issues, it may be awhile though. This project is being made for the custom WOTLK server; Felskorn WoW(https://felskorn.com/). It will not be an exact replica of the blizzlike version. Some features and design choices will be created with Felskorn WoW's vision in mind. This will however be open-sourced and updated periodically. You're free to use it on your own servers if you desire.
